        <h1>Unwavering Will</h1>
        <p>A mind ablaze, a spirit bright,<br>
            A quest for knowledge, a noble sight.<br>
            Through trials and errors, doubts and fears,<br>
            A steadfast heart, that perseveres.<br>
        </p>  
        <p>The weight of books, a heavy load,<br>
            Yet shoulders strong, along the road.<br>
            Late nights of study, a weary sigh,<br>
            But dawn breaks forth, a promise nigh.<br>
        </p> 
        <p>With every challenge, a lesson learned,<br>
            A resilience forged, a spirit burned.<br>
            Each setback, a chance to rise,<br>
            With renewed vigor, to touch the skies.<br>
        </p> 
        <p>For in the depths of academic strife,<br>
            Resides a power, a force of life.<br>
            A mind that bends, but never breaks,<br>
            A scholar's journey, for goodness' sake.<br>
        </p>
