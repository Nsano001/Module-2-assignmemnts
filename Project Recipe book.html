        <h2>Preparation Steps</h2>
        <h3 id="Jollof" >Jollof Rice</h3>
        <p> Start by heating the vegetable oil in a pot over medium heat. Add the chopped onions and garlic, saut√© until golden brown. Stir in the blended tomatoes, red bell peppers, and tomato paste, cooking until the mixture thickens and the oil begins to separate. Season with curry powder, thyme, salt, and black pepper. Pour in the chicken or vegetable broth and bring it to a boil. Add the rice, reduce the heat, cover the pot, and let it simmer until the rice is cooked and the flavors are absorbed. Add mixed vegetables if desired, and cook until tender. Serve hot.</p>

        <h3 id="Egusi" >Egusi Soup</h3>
        <p>Begin by heating the palm oil in a pot over medium heat. Add the chopped onions and stir until softened. Next, add the ground egusi and stir continuously to avoid burning, cooking until it thickens. Add the ground crayfish, chopped scotch bonnet pepper, and bouillon cube, stirring well. Pour in water gradually, followed by the meat or fish, if using, and let it simmer until cooked. Add the spinach or ugu leaves and salt to taste. Allow it to simmer until the vegetables are tender and the soup has thickened to your liking. Serve with fufu or pounded yam.</p>

        <h3 id="Puff-Puff">Puff-Puff</h3>
        <p>In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, yeast, nutmeg, and a pinch of salt. Gradually add warm water, mixing until the batter is smooth and slightly sticky. Cover the bowl with a cloth and let it sit in a warm place for 1-2 hours, allowing the batter to rise and double in size. Heat vegetable oil in a deep pot over medium heat. Scoop spoonfuls of the batter into the hot oil, frying until golden brown on all sides. Remove and drain on paper towels. Serve warm as a snack or dessert.</p>
